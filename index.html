        <h2>Analyst Recommendation: Why Perth Stands Out</h2>
        <p class="summary">The analyst recommends <strong>Perth, Australia</strong> for the family—an Australian individual, a Czech/Australian spouse, and their 3-year-old child (Czech/Australian). The reasoning is as follows:</p>
        <ul class="summary">
            <li><strong>Career Growth</strong>: Perth provides a solid entry-level salary (€1,800–€2,300/month) and access to over 450 IT service desk jobs monthly across Australia. Within 5–10 years, earnings could reach €3,000–€4,500/month, surpassing Prague’s maximum of €1,800–€3,000 and offering a faster financial recovery than Sydney.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Finances</strong>: Monthly expenses (€2,670–€3,580) exceed Prague’s (€1,650–€2,725) but are 25% lower than Sydney’s (€3,680–€4,950). Childcare costs (€900–€1,200) are significant until free public schooling begins, yet long-term salary potential offsets this burden.</li>
            <li><strong>Citizenship Benefits</strong>: All family members benefit from free healthcare and education in Australia via Medicare and public systems. While Czech citizenship aids in Prague, Perth delivers comparable advantages without linguistic challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Suitability</strong>: Perth offers beaches, a relaxed pace, and a family-oriented environment—ideal for a young child. It avoids Sydney’s intensity and Prague’s colder climate, striking a practical balance.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Stability</strong>: Australia’s projected tech growth (1.2 million jobs by 2030) outpaces Czechia’s limited market. Perth combines affordability with access to this expanding sector.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="summary">Prague offers immediate savings but restricts career advancement. Sydney’s high costs outweigh its earning potential initially. Perth provides the optimal mix of professional opportunity, family support, and quality of life for the family’s future.</p>
