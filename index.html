        <h2>Why Perth is Our Best Choice</h2>
        <p class="analysis">As an analyst, I recommend <strong>Perth, Australia</strong> for our family—me (Australian), my wife (Czech/Australian), and our 3-year-old daughter (Czech/Australian). Here’s why:</p>
        <ul class="analysis">
            <li><strong>Career Growth</strong>: Perth gives me a decent starting salary (€1,800–€2,300/month) and access to Australia’s 450+ IT service desk jobs monthly. In 5–10 years, I could earn €3,000–€4,500/month, far outpacing Prague’s €1,800–€3,000 cap and closing the cost gap faster than Sydney.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Finances</strong>: Monthly costs (€2,670–€3,580) are higher than Prague (€1,650–€2,725) but 25% cheaper than Sydney (€3,680–€4,950). Childcare (€900–€1,200) is a hit until school (free for citizens), but long-term income growth balances it.</li>
            <li><strong>Citizenship Edge</strong>: We all get free healthcare and education in Australia. Your Czech citizenship helps in Prague, but Perth’s benefits match up without language barriers.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Fit</strong>: Perth’s beaches, relaxed pace, and family focus suit us with a toddler—less chaotic than Sydney, warmer than Prague. It’s a middle ground between Prague’s charm and Sydney’s buzz.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Stability</strong>: Australia’s tech boom (1.2M jobs by 2030) offers more security than Czechia’s smaller market. Perth keeps costs manageable while tapping that growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="analysis">Prague saves money now but limits my career. Sydney’s too expensive early on. Perth strikes the best balance for our future—work, family, and fun.</p>
